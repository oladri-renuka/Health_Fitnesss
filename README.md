This is an AI-powered Health and Fitness App that offers three main functionalities:
1. **üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏èPCOS Prediction**: Predicts the likelihood of PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) based on user inputs.
2. **ü•óDiet Recommendations**: Provides personalized meal recommendations based on user preferences, age, weight, height, activity level, and goals.
3. **üèãÔ∏èExercise Recommendations**: Suggests personalized exercise plans based on gender, age, weight, fitness level, and goals.

## Features

### 1. üî¨PCOS Prediction
- The app predicts if a user has PCOS based on the following inputs:
  - Cycle regularity
  - Weight gain
  - Hair growth
  - Skin darkening
  - Fast food consumption
  - Follicle counts in ovaries
  
- It uses an XGBoost model to predict the result, which will either indicate **PCOS Detected** or **No PCOS**.

### 2. ü•óDiet Recommendations
- The app suggests personalized meal plans based on:
  - Age
  - Sex
  - Weight and height
  - Activity level
  - Goal (weight loss, weight gain, or maintenance)
  - Diet preference (e.g., vegetarian, vegan)
  - Allergies
  
- After input, the app will provide meal suggestions tailored to the user's inputs.

### 3. üèãÔ∏èExercise Plan Recommendations
- The app generates a personalized exercise plan based on:
  - Gender
  - Age
  - Weight and height
  - Fitness level
  - Fitness goal (weight loss or weight gain)
  - Fitness type (cardio or muscular fitness)
  
- The user gets a customized exercise plan to help them reach their fitness goal.
